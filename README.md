# CS255-Porfolio
Portfolio for CS255

- Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The DriverPass project was a brand new system for a company that provides practice tests and on-the-road training
to help people pass their driver's license test. The client wanted an online application that would enable them
to offer online practice tests, courses, and on-the-road training sessions with instructors.

- What did you do particularly well?

I was able to understand the scope of the project and translate it into technical details effectively.
This helped me create usefull diagrams and documents that were technical enough for engineers yet
simple enough for a non-technical audience.

- If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

If I had more time, I would developed the UML class diagram more. I feel like I could have added more classes and relationships
to better capture all of the required technical components.

- How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I leveraged the interview document in order to gather the requirements of the system. If the system does not
meet the needs of the user, it is a waste of time, engergy, and money. Systems should be tightly coupled
with the user in order to ensure usefull and impactful software.

- How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

When designing sofware solutions, I follow a structured and step-by-step approach. I first think of the problem statement
or requirements thoroughly. I think start to think of the simplest software or tools that can solve the problem.
Next, I like to create a high-level architecture of the system to solidify understanding of the approach.
In the future, I may end up leveraging sequence diagrams into my design phase. For somewhat complex use cases,
I think sequence diagrams are a good tool to visualize the flow of data and events in a system.
