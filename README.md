# CS255-Porfolio
Portfolio for CS255

- Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The DriverPass project was a brand-new system for a company that provides practice tests and on-the-road training to help people pass their driver's license test. 
The client wanted an online application that would enable them to offer online practice tests, courses, and on-the-road training sessions with instructors.

- What did you do particularly well?

I was able to understand the scope of the project and translate it into technical details effectively. 
This helped me create useful diagrams and documents that were technical enough for engineers yet simple enough for a non-technical audience.

- If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

If I had more time, I would have developed the UML class diagram further. 
I feel like I could have added more classes and relationships to better capture all of the required technical components.

- How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I leveraged the interview document to gather the system requirements.
If the system does not meet the needs of the user, it is a waste of time, energy, and money.
Systems should be tightly coupled with the user to ensure useful and impactful software.

- How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

When designing software solutions, I follow a structured and step-by-step approach. 
I first think through the problem statement or requirements thoroughly. 
I then start to think of the simplest software or tools that can solve the problem. 
Next, I like to create a high-level architecture of the system to solidify my understanding of the approach. 
In the future, I may leverage sequence diagrams in my design phase. 
For somewhat complex use cases, I think sequence diagrams are a good tool to visualize the flow of data and events in a system.
